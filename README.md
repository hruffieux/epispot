## Overview

**epispot** is an R package for molecular QTL mapping that integrates
large-scale epigenetic annotations to enhance the detection and
interpretation of *cis-* and *trans-* acting QTLs, including hotspots.
It employs a Bayesian variational expectation-maximisation approach to
jointly analyse thousands of molecular phenotypes (e.g., gene, protein
or metabolite levels) and genetic variants while incorporating
epigenetic marks as candidate auxiliary data on the potential of genetic
variants to control traits.
