## Overview

**epispot** is an R package for molecular QTL mapping that integrates 
large-scale epigenetic annotations to enhance the detection and interpretation 
of *cis-* and *trans-* acting QTLs, including hotspots. It employs a Bayesian 
variational expectation-maximisation approach to jointly analyse thousands of 
molecular phenotypes (e.g., gene, protein or metabolite levels) and genetic 
variants while incorporating epigenetic marks as candidate auxiliary data on the 
potential of genetic variants to control traits.
